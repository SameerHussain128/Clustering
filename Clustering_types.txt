In Machine learning there are two types Supervised learning and UnSupervised learning.
Supervised   - Deals with labeled data.
UnSupervised - Deals with Unlabeled data.

Unsupervised machine learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets.
Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasksâ€”clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction.

k-means clustering : 
* It a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

Hierarchical clustering : 
* It is a method of cluster analysis in data mining that creates a hierarchical representation of the clusters in a dataset. The method starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster and then iteratively combines the closest clusters until a stopping criterion is reached.
* Agglomerative Clustering - Initially all data points are cluster of its own. Then, take two nearest clusters and join them to form one single cluster. Proceed step 2 until you obtain the desired number of clusters.

* Dendrogram is a tree-structured graph used in heat maps to visualize the result of a hierarchical clustering calculation. Top to bottom approach.

DBSCAN Clustering :
* It is a density-based clustering algorithm that works on the assumption that clusters are dense regions in space separated by regions of lower density.
- It contains one centroid in a Cluster, Border point, Outlier
- condition is is cluster has less than or equal to 4 points (whether one point centroid) then it is cluster and has one centroid and
- if has only three or below points then there are border
and the point is one are far is known as Outlier.
Dbscan works with non-linear data aslo.
